# Wifi-speedtest-GUI-Application
In this project i have created an internet speed testing application which can notify about the download speed, upload speed, and also the ping which is the reaction time of the connection.
The application will also detect whether or not the system is connected to internet connection and can notify about it.
I have created the application using tkinter,PIL,speedtest,win10toast and urllib3.
